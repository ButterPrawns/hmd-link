# hmd.link

*(HMD) = head-mounted display*

Send URLs instantly from a 2D device to an immersive headset on your network, no setup required.

No more typing long URLs with unweildy motion controllers â€” 8 characters (or 1 bookmark) is all you need! Just type [hmd.link](https://hmd.link) into your VR browser to access your link.

## What is this sorcery?

Inspired by the local file sharing app [ShareDrop](https://www.sharedrop.io/), this app uses your public IP address to automatically connect devices on the same network. However, since it's just  text being shared, there's no fancy P2P stuff going on, just a simple database.

## Why use this?

As of July 2020, there is still no easy way to access WebXR content on consumer headsets. Some browsers like Firefox Reality offer a way to sync bookmarks and tabs with their 2D counterpart, but it requires additional setup. Others, like the built-in Oculus Browser don't have such a feature.
